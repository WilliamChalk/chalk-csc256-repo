# About Me
Hello My Name is William Chalk, This Repo is for my CSC 256 Software Quality Assurance class. 
I am looking forward to learning more about the different testing methods and libraries used in the industry.
I have some experience with testing libraries so far, such as Jest, Jasmine, and Playwright.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have enjoyed learning about them, and using them in my work. I understand that testing is an important process in software development, it decreases the amount of bugs greatly.
Playwright has been the easiest to learn so far, with Jasmine being the most recent, they each are used for different testing methods in software development. 
# Goals
My goal is to finish my degree soon and get a full time postion as a software developer, I am currently under contract working as a software developer which has exposed me to many new technologies. 
I have enjoyed my work so far and hope to continue my career path. I am looking forward to learning with all my classmates this semester, and working on a group project creating and testing software that we will develop,
